		Website.sh simplifies the process of setting up a new website locally. Think of it as code-snippets for files. When the script is run it will guide you through a few quick prompts of what you'd like in your project and what you'd like it named. You'll be in and out in 10 seconds tops. This is how creating a project should work.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Website.sh runs as a native terminal command so there is no fiddling with paths and such. Just call it up with the command "setupwebsite" in your terminal prompt and it'll take over from there. When its done creating the files and folders of a basic website it will put your neatly created folder on your desktop that you can drag to where you please.

	Installation is easy! Just copy and paste these instructions into your command prompt and you'll be good to go:<br><br>
	$ curl -L -O https://github.com/taylorsatula/Website.sh/releases/download/1.1/setupwebsite<br>
	$ chmod u+x setupwebsite<br>
	$ sudo mv setupwebsite /usr/bin/<br>
	$ setupwebsite
	</code>
	
	<br><br>
	
	<p>
		And thats it! You have installed the script and also run it once to make sure all is working well.
