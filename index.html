			Website.sh simplifies the process of setting up a new website locally. Think of it as code-snippets for files. When the script is run it will guide you through a few quick prompts of what you'd like in your project and what you'd like it named. You'll be in and out in 10 seconds tops. This is how creating a project should work.
		</p>
		<p>
			This script was created originally on a whim as I was setting up multiple new projects and I kept having to either write new code over and over copy and paste code from file to file. That absolutely sucked. I had never written even a shell script at the time so I decided that it was high-time to learn. One thing lead to another and Website.sh turned into a proper command line application.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Website.sh runs as a native terminal command so there is no fiddling with paths and such. Just call it up with the command <span class="monospaced">"setupwebsite"</span> in your command prompt and it'll take over from there. When its done creating the files and folders of a basic website it will put your neatly created folder on your desktop that you can drag to where you please.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Installation is easy! Just copy and paste these instructions into your command prompt and you'll be good to go:<br>
			<span class="codeWrapper">
				<code>
					$ curl -L -O https://github.com/taylorsatula/Website.sh/releases/download/1.0/setupwebsite<br>
					$ chmod u+x setupwebsite<br>
					$ mv setupwebsite /usr/bin/<br>
					$ setupwebsite<br>
				</code>
			</span>
			<br>
			
			And thats it! You have installed the script and also run it once to make sure all is working well.
