			Website.sh simplifies the process of setting up a new website locally. Think of it as code-snippets for files. When the script is run it will guide you through a few quick prompts of what you'd like in your project and what you'd like it named. You'll be in and out in 10 seconds tops. This is how creating a project should work.
		</p>
		<p>
			This script was created originally on a whim as I was setting up multiple new projects and I kept having to either write new code over and over copy and paste code from file to file. That absolutely sucked. I had never written even a shell script at the time so I decided that it was high-time to learn. One thing lead to another and Website.sh turned into a proper command line application.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Website.sh runs as a native terminal command so there is no fiddling with paths and such. Just call it up with the command <span class="monospaced">"setupwebsite"</span> in your command prompt and it'll take over from there. When its done creating the files and folders of a basic website it will put your neatly created folder on your desktop that you can drag to where you please.

			Installation is easy! If you have <a href="http://brew.sh" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> all you have to do is run:<br>
			<code>
				brew install setupwebsite
			</code>
			<br>
			OR if you want to install it without <a href="http://brew.sh" rel="nofollow">Homebrew</a> just run this in the terminal prompt:<br>
			<code>
				ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/taylorsatula/website_setup/install)"
			</code>

When I'm not fiddling with Website.sh I'm making snazzy websites and doing cool things with CSS. Check out some of my work and drop me a line if you'd like work work with me.
