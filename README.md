New Project Template
=============

Setting up new projects sucks. This helps.

When this script is run it creates a folder in the same directory that the script is in and populates it with 
    foldername/
    foldername/images/
    foldername/javascript/
    foldername/index.html
    foldername/style.css
By default these are filled with a basic HTML5 page and Eric Meyer's CSS reset.
The CSS document is even linked to the HTML document automatically.

Before running for the first time you may have to make the script executable by running the
	chmod +x Website-Setup.sh
This will set it up so all you have to is call the script from terminal and it'll go about its business.
